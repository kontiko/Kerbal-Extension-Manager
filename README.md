<h1>KEM</h1>

Kem is a Python 3 based Programm to manage your Mods
you can add mods and remove them and install and uninstall them.

when you uninstall a mod it will only remove files which are only dependent for this mod.
so you can easily uninstall mods without watching out for dependencies of other mods.
